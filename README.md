### Kaggle Bird Classification Competition
Project Created by Seulchan Han and Daniel Tameishi

## Introduction
The project was focused on competiting in a Kaggle bird classifying competion using several computer vision techniques. The goal of the competition was to have the highest accuracy possible. To acheive this, we explored multiple different techniques such as transfer learning with multiple different models, as well as experimenting with hyperparemeters and data augmentation.
